Sky Child Theme
================

This is a good example of a company that has done a good job of 
designing their Templates for extension.  This is an example of 
a child extension.  

In this example, the plugin gets bundled using [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org/ "Gradle Buildtools").
This guarantees that everything is up to date and that packaging is 
consistent.  Gradle is the best build tool that I've come across thus far
and I hope and suggest that everyone look into it, as it is the future for 
JVM languages, if not others.  Please note that I have also checked in the
"Gradle Wrapper", which allows you to execute the gradle build without needing
to install Gradle (though the JVM is required).  To do this, just go to the root
of the project and execute the command "gradle".

Child Theme development is described at http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes.  You can also find a simple
example that just modifies the css by following the instructions at http://op111.net/53/.
 
This child theme extension is meant to be an example for others writing child themes and for folks 
that are extending themes from https://www.elegantthemes.com/.
